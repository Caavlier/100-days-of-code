# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 03, 2025
#### Matplotlib
**Today's Progress**: Reading Zen lectures about good habits and starting using Matplotlib.
**Thoughts:** Reading "How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year" by A. Kallaway gave me a clear idea of how this has to be done. It was really encourage. On the other hand, I struggled whit using ticks for plots, but reading documentation help me to figure it out.

### Day 2: August 04, 2025 
#### Probability
**Today's Progress**: Lectures on basic probability and applied concepts into Monte Carlo simulations using numpy, random and fuction choice.
**Thoughts**: My first approach to solve this problem was using numpy and 2D arrays. After implementing my code I received a tip: Use function '.choice'.  This make all so easy!
